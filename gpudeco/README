This code is GPU based A*star searh. It's preliminary and mainly for experimental purpose. 

To run GPU based A*Search, please first define the numer of vectors and edges for different workflows in the cudaheader.h like the following. 

#define VSIZE 100 
#define ESIZE 233

For montage, the VSIZE is 20 and the ESIZE is 33. For montage100, the VSIZE is 100 and the ESIZE is 233. For montage1000, the VSIZE is 1000 and the ESIZE is 2333. 

Example parameters to run the code:
montage 15000 0.96 0.1 1 1000 ours deadline 500 constant
montage100 15000 0.96 0.1 1 1000 ours deadline 10
montage1000 15000 0.96 0.1 1 1000 ours deadline 500 constant
